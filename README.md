**"Formamentis Networks for Emotional Alignment in Language Models"**
*Matteo Massari, April 2025*

## Abstract
This project investigates the emotional coherence of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of **Forma Mentis Networks (FMNs)** â€” semantic-emotional graphs enriched with affective information. Using a consistent narrative prompt under both positive and negative emotional conditions, we study how temperature influences the emotional alignment of GPT-like models. Structural, emotional, and classification analyses reveal that LLMs often fail to maintain affective coherence, especially under negative prompting and high temperature values.

## Methodology

* **Narrative Prompting**: A fixed monologue scenario from a 25-year-old data scientist in London, presented in both positive and negative tones.
* **Temperature Variation**: Texts are generated at temperatures 0.1, 0.7, and 1.3.
* **FMN Construction**: Outputs are parsed into Forma Mentis Networks, enriched with Plutchik's emotional categories.
* **Emotional Classification**: Texts are reclassified using absolute counts of positive/negative emotions, yielding confusion matrices for each setting. The classification process in made with NLP techniques and one shoot BERT

## Key Findings

* **Structural Trends**: Higher temperature increases lexical diversity but decreases conceptual density.
* **Emotional Coherence**: Low temperature yields emotionally aligned FMNs; high temperature results in semantic drift and emotional incoherence.
* **Bias Toward Positivity**: The model struggles to express negative emotional states, showing a strong bias toward positive valence regardless of the prompt.
